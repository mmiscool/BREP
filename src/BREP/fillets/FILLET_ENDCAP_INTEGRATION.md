# Fillet Endcap Integration

## Overview

The `FilletSolid` class now includes automatic endcap generation to ensure manifold geometry for open edges. This integration addresses non-manifold issues that can arise during fillet construction, particularly for open edge fillets.

## Key Features

### Automatic Endcap Detection and Generation
- **Boundary Detection**: Automatically detects non-manifold boundary loops in the fillet geometry
- **Smart Triangulation**: Uses appropriate triangulation methods based on boundary complexity
- **Manifold Validation**: Only generates endcaps when the mesh is determined to be non-manifold

### Integration Points

The endcap generation is integrated at two key points in the fillet construction process:

1. **Post-Construction** (Line ~567): After building the main wedge and side strips but before cleanup
2. **Pre-Final** (Line ~607): After inflation and cleanup, as a final manifold enforcement step

### Methods Added

#### `_generateEndcapsIfNeeded(radius, baseName)`
- Main method that orchestrates endcap generation
- Checks if mesh is already manifold before proceeding
- Generates endcaps for detected boundary loops
- Returns count of endcaps generated

#### `_detectBoundaryLoops()`
- Analyzes mesh topology to find non-manifold boundary edges
- Builds adjacency maps and traces connected boundary loops
- Returns array of boundary loops with ordered vertex positions

#### `_traceBoundaryLoop(start, adj, visited)`
- Traces a single boundary loop starting from a given vertex
- Handles both closed loops and open boundaries
- Returns ordered array of vertex indices

#### `_computeLoopNormal(points)`
- Computes robust normal vector for boundary loops using Newell's method
- Handles non-planar boundaries gracefully
- Provides fallback normal if computation fails

## Configuration Options

### Triangulation Methods
- **Fan Triangulation**: Fast method for simple convex boundaries (≤4 vertices)
- **Ear Clipping**: Robust method for complex non-convex boundaries (>4 vertices)
- **Automatic Selection**: Algorithm chooses optimal method based on boundary complexity

### Tolerances
- **Area Threshold**: `max(1e-12, 1e-9 * radius²)` - prevents degenerate triangles
- **Weld Tolerance**: `max(1e-9, 1e-6 * radius)` - cleans up duplicate vertices after endcap generation

## Usage

The endcap generation is fully automatic and requires no user intervention:

```javascript
// Automatic endcap generation for open edges
const filletSolid = new FilletSolid({
    edgeToFillet: selectedEdge,
    radius: 2.0,
    sideMode: 'INSET',
    debug: true  // Enable logging for endcap generation
});
```

### Debug Output
When `debug: true` is enabled, the system provides detailed logging:
- Number of initial endcaps generated after wedge construction
- Number of final endcaps generated after cleanup
- Detailed information about each endcap (name, triangle count)
- Warning messages for failed endcap generation attempts

## Error Handling

The endcap generation includes comprehensive error handling:
- **Graceful Degradation**: Failures in endcap generation don't stop fillet construction
- **Selective Application**: Only applies to open edges where manifold issues are likely
- **Debug Logging**: Detailed error messages when debug mode is enabled
- **Fallback Cleanup**: Even if endcap generation fails, standard cleanup still occurs

## Performance Considerations

### When Endcaps are Generated
- **Open Edges Only**: Closed edges skip endcap generation entirely
- **Manifold Check**: If mesh is already manifold, endcap generation is skipped
- **Boundary Detection**: Fast edge-counting algorithm determines if boundaries exist

### Optimization Features
- **Early Exit**: Skips processing if no boundary loops are detected
- **Efficient Adjacency**: Uses hash maps for O(1) edge lookup during boundary tracing
- **Minimal Overhead**: Only processes boundary vertices, not entire mesh

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Face Naming Convention
- Endcaps use naming pattern: `${baseName}_ENDCAP_${index}`
- Example: `FILLET_FACE_A|FACE_B_ENDCAP_0`

### Cleanup Integration
- Endcaps are subject to same welding and cleanup as main geometry
- Triangle winding is fixed after endcap generation
- Degenerate triangles are removed with same tolerances

### CSG Compatibility
- Endcaps maintain face ID consistency for boolean operations
- Proper manifold topology ensures reliable CSG results
- Face labels propagate through boolean operations as expected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No Endcaps Generated**: Mesh may already be manifold, or no boundary loops detected
2. **Endcap Generation Failed**: Complex boundary geometry may require manual intervention
3. **Excessive Triangle Count**: Very complex boundaries may generate many small triangles

### Debug Information
Enable debug mode to get detailed information:
```javascript
const fillet = new FilletSolid({ ..., debug: true });
```

This will log:
- Boundary loop detection results
- Triangle counts for each endcap
- Failure messages with specific error details

### Manual Intervention
If automatic endcap generation fails, consider:
- Simplifying the input edge geometry
- Adjusting the fillet radius
- Using different side modes (INSET vs OUTSET)
- Manual mesh repair using external tools
