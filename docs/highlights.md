# Highlights

- Feature history pipeline with a compact UI to add, edit, and replay features.
- Robust CSG powered by `manifold-3d` with face-label provenance that survives booleans.
- Mesh-to-BREP conversion groups triangles into faces using normal deflection so selections make sense.
- Mesh repair pipeline includes weld, T-junction fix, overlap removal, hole fill, and normal cleanup.
- Import and export support STL, OBJ, and feature-aware 3MF (with embedded history).
- Primitive solids (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone, torus, pyramid) and common CAD features (sketch/extrude, sweep, loft, revolve, fillet, chamfer, mirror, booleans).
- Modular toolbar with Save, Zoom to Fit, Wireframe toggle, Import/Export, About, and Selection Filter access.
- Browser test runner captures per-test canvas snapshots and shows them in the log dialog.
- Simple plugin system lets you import plugins from GitHub repositories.
