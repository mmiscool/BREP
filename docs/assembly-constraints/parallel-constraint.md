# Parallel Constraint

Status: Implemented

Parallel constraints align the directions of two faces, edges, or components. They are the primary orientation tool for planar or cylindrical features that must stay parallel without requiring contact.

## Inputs
- `constraintID` – unique identifier surfaced in the UI.
- `elements` – two selections (faces, edges, or components). Each selection must resolve to a direction vector.
- `applyImmediately` – historical flag retained for UI compatibility; the solver always iterates instead of applying a single shot correction.
- `reverse` – toggles the stored orientation preference so the constraint can align outward-facing normals instead of inward-facing normals.

## Behaviour
- Resolves both selections using the parallel alignment utilities, which gather a world-space origin, direction, and normal sampling metadata.
- Stores an orientation preference (`persistentData.preferredOppose`) the first time the constraint runs. Subsequent solves reuse that preference until `reverse` flips it.
- Delegates the heavy lifting to `solveParallelAlignment()` in `constraintUtils/parallelAlignment.js`, which computes the quaternion(s) necessary to make the direction vectors parallel while respecting `MAX_ROTATION_PER_ITERATION`.
- Fills `persistentData.error` and `persistentData.errorDeg` with the angular difference so the UI can display progress down to very small tolerances.
- Emits optional debug arrows when the solver runs in `debugMode` to visualise the directions currently being enforced.

## Usage Tips
- Combine Parallel with Distance or Coincident when you need both orientation and translation control.
- If the constraint keeps flipping between inward and outward normals, toggle the `reverse` flag to pin the preferred orientation.
- Keep an eye on `lastAppliedRotations`; sustained non-zero rotations usually indicate other constraints are pulling the components out of alignment between iterations.
