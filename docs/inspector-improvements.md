# Recent Inspector Improvements

- Face area display shows surface area with formatted units.
- Edge length measurement reports lengths with formatted units.
- Objects display the owning feature (`Created by: FeatureID`).
- Lazy loading defers heavy triangle and point data until the section expands, improving performance on complex models.
- Inspector sections for triangles, vertices, and points expand on demand to avoid freezing the UI.
