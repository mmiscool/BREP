## [Source repo https://github.com/mmiscool/BREP](https://github.com/mmiscool/BREP)

A feature-based modeling playground experimenting with BREP-style workflows on top of triangle meshes. It combines robust manifold CSG (via the [Manifold](https://github.com/elalish/manifold/) library) with a simple face and edge representation, a history pipeline, and Three.js visualization. Import meshes (STL), repair and group them into faces, then perform boolean operations, fillets, chamfers, sweeps, lofts, and more.

This project is actively evolving; expect rough edges while APIs settle.
