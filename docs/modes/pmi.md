# PMI Mode

PMI (Product Manufacturing Information) Mode focuses on annotations, dimensions, and callouts. Activate it to place linear, radial, and leader dimensions that communicate manufacturing intent without altering the underlying solid.

Capabilities:
- Place linear, radial, and angular dimensions with associative snapping to faces or edges
- Add leader annotations that reference points, faces, or datums
- Configure formatting through the PMI inspector and label overlay panels

Use PMI Mode after modeling is complete to capture critical tolerances, notes, and inspection data directly on the 3D model.
